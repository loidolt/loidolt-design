## Who Am I?

My name is Chris Loidolt.

I like learning and creating.  I strongly believe the world needs more of that.

Born and raised in Colorado, I now live in Monument and enjoy taking advantage of what this beautiful place has to offer. I have been building, drawing, designing, carving, modeling, programming, soldering, sewing, capturing, and flying for as long as I can remember.

My personality can be best defined by my level of creativity and quality in work. Speak softly and carry an impressive portfolio.
