# Summary

These acrylic business card holders weâ€™re made for Cassidy Design, a home design company in Colorado Springs. The owner wanted a way to display her business cards more prominently during open house events and walkthroughs.

The design uses two square pieces of 1/2 inch acrylic held together with magnets. One side has a pocket to index the business card and the other is flat. All cut surfaces were sanded and flame polished to bring back an optically clear edge.
