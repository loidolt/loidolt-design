## Summary

This is an automatic winding machine for coiling up small cords, strings, or wires. We needed a way to reliably coil up specific lengths of cord for sale in a kit. This machine is the updated version of my original Automatic Winding Machine, making it more reliable, easier to use, and above all much, much quieter.

The rotary encoder keeps track of the distance coiled with a closed-loop system. This allows more foolproof operation, recovery if the spool hangs up or jams, and the ability to adjust the diameter of the coil without having to change the code.

This version features an LCD display with button controls, easy to edit firmware, more robust encoder guide system, an integrated spool holder, a quiet belt-driven platter, enclosed electronics, and a ton of other tiny tweaks and improvements.

Let me know if you have any questions or need build instructions. I'm happy to provide more detail but will need time to do the full instructional write-up. I can also provide pre-built custom acrylic panels and aluminum plates on request for a small fee.

Happy building!

PLA or PETG

Notes:
Print the Encoder Wheel and Idler Wheel at high resolution, I used 0.1 mm layer height and 3 perimeters. These can also be printed in flexible filament for more grip if necessary.

Print the Plate Shaft Mount solid (100% infill) to ensure it is nice and rigid.
