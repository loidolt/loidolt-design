## Summary

The boathouse at the Milton Camp has a powered winch to pull watercraft up the ramp. The winch is located at the back of the boathouse and has to make a trip to the waterfront down a slope causing it to rub harshly on the wood flooring where it transitions from the flat interior to the sloped ramp. This HDPE plate was made to provide something smooth, tough, and most importantly sacrificial for the cable to ride against.
