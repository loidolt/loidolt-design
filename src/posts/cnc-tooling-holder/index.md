## Summary

This is a simple tooling holder for my Shapeoko 3. It has various slots to house the tools needed for regular machine maintenance, collets, and of course ample space for 1/4" and 1/8" endmills.

The part was designed in Fusion 360 and milled out of knotty alder using the Shapeoko 3. Finished with a spray-on lacquer.
