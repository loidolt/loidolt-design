# Summary

Just a quick and simple project to organize, centralize, and hide the networking equipment in my parents house.

I was able to fit everything inside a recessed networking box behind the mounting structure for their wall mounted TV. All cables are now labeled, managed, and everything that can be is now hardwired.
