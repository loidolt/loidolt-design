## Summary

These earrings were commissioned pieces for a friend. They are made from walnut with a hand-carved compass rose inlay in the face of each. I originally attempted to make them out of wenge, but I found the difference in hardness of the grain segments to be too difficult to in which to carve fine detail. A design was made in SketchUp and then transferred to wood, then the inlay was carved and filled with casting resin, colored with copper paint. The resin was sanded down smooth and the final shapes were cut, shaped, and finished using mineral oil and ren wax.
