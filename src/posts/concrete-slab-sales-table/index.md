## Summary

Faux concrete table built for the new model home sales office in the Classic Homes Midtown Collection. To move the table and make it small enough to fit through a standard size door, the top was made to lift off the base.

The frame was built from 2x4's with a simple construction method of butt joints, glue, and screws. Then the frame was covered in 3/8" OSB and coated with Henry's feather coat skim coating to create a faux concrete surface. Finally, a concrete sealer was applied in several coats to create a tough, waterproof seal.
