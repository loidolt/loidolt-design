## Summary

Just a simple set of storage units for our crawlspace.

This build was interesting due to the very uneven floor in the crawlspace and the small crawlspace entry which is also located above a bathroom sink. As a result, we had to partially pre-fabricate the shelves in the shop and then finish building them in place in the crawlspace.

The result is a lot of extra, heated, storage for items like paint and other house supplies.
