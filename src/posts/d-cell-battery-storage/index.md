## Summary

I needed a way to store CR2032 and CR2450 coin cell batteries in our battery organizer for all the smart home sensors. I designed these little D-Cell size coin cell battery trays to make some of the unnecessary slots in the organizer useful.

These trays should work in any vertical battery organizer with D Cell size battery slots.
