## Summary

This longbow was custom built for Davis Cagle. The outer limbs are zebrawood with a core of maple. The handle is Brazilian cherry with a wenge, maple, and padauk inlay. The build-ups on the outside of the handle are maple, wenge, and have a Bacote highlight on top. The bow is 50 pounds at 28 inches and is the best shooting longbow Iâ€™ve made yet - no handle shock whatsoever and it has a really satisfying thump.
