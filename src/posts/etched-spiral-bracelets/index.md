# Summary

These bracelets were made as gifts for my mother and my bride's mother for our wedding. They are a leather bracelet with magnetic clasp, that has a laser and acid etched aluminum strip curled around the leather.

In order to etch the aluminum, we first spray painted the aluminum sheet with flat black spray paint. Then the spray paint was burned away to reveal the outline of each strip and the letters using the laser cutter. Then both strips we're placed in an etch-ant solution to slightly eat away the exposed aluminum.

Once we had a nicely etched plate, each strip was cut out, sanded, polished, and wrapped around a dowel to create the curl.
