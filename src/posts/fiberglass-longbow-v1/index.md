# Summary

This bow turned out fairly nice for a first attempt. The limbs are wenge with a cherry core. The riser is Brazilian cherry with an inlay consisting of wenge, maple, padauk, and cherry. Had a couple issues with the glue up. Large bubble under the surface and some gap issues. The gap was able to be fixed with sanding down and building back up with an accent, but sadly, the bubble remains. Final draw weight is 45 pounds at 28 inches. Shoots really nice, very little hand shock. Little bit of string twang but that was easily silenced with some string fuzzy things. I will be moving forward with this form shape and the general design for the bow.
