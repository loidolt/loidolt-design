Simple mount for the cheap (but very useful) First Alert AF400 Tundra Fire Extinguishing Aerosol Spray cans that can be found many places, amazon link below:

[https://a.co/d/9RIgKF1](https://a.co/d/9RIgKF1)

This mount allows you to create an easy access home for the fire extinguisher. The can simply sets in the bottom base and then presses into the clip with a spring fit. The can sits far enough off the wall when in the mount for you to easily grab the can quickly in case of an emergency.

You will need one clip and one bottom piece for each can you want to mount.
