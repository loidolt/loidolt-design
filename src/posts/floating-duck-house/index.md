## Summary

This floating duck house was made as a commission for a family friend's Mother's Day present. It is primarily made of cedar, with a pressure-treated frame at the base to give something solid to attach to.

Floatation is provided by 2 gallons of 2 lb marine floatation foam. I lined the base with plastic and poured the foam into the cavity. Altogether there should be about 1000 lbs of flotation, and it appears to be very stable in the water.

I made a laser-cut plaque that parody's the Lodge at Flying Horse logo, which is owned by the family who will be receiving the duck house.

This was a rushed, but fun project. I'm very pleased with the outcome.
