## Summary

This is a quite large metal "cookie-cutter" version of the Foothills Farm logo that was made to be used as a concrete form. They needed something durable and modular enough to be used to cast the logo in several large pavers around the community.

The form is bolted together in two halves. Additionally, the end pieces of each half are removable to give every possible shot at getting this back out of freshly set concrete.
