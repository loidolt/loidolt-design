# Summary

This french cleat headphone rack was built as a Christmas present for my soon-to-be Father-In-Law, Bill Milton.

The design uses a french cleat style mounting system. However, as the pieces are very short and narrow, I had to add a second "cleat" on the bottom of the horizontal bar to keep theÂ headphone mounts from twisting or falling off.

Each headphone holder is comprised of four parts, all cut on the CNC. These parts all interlock using lap joints and dowels, with the exception of the curved top piece, which has no dowels.

All parts were finished using semi-gloss spray lacquer, and then a quick coat of renaissance wax to keep things sliding nicely.
