## Summary

This cabinet/book holder was built as a gift for the Smiths as a thank you for letting us stay at his house in Hawaii. Afrormosia wood is used across the entire build to match the wood in his Hawaii home and the top is sized to hold a guest book ledger for people to fill out. 

The lower portion of the cabinet houses an instant photo printer on the left-hand side and supplies on the right-hand side. The printer allows guests to take a photo of them having fun on the property, print it out, and include it in their guest entry so the Smiths have something to look through when they return.
