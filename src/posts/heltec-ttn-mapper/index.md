## Summary

Remix of this well designed case [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4729713](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4729713) by mak0t0san to fit a slightly larger battery, a small slide switch, and some extra room for a GPS module.

I'm using this case as a TTN Mapper, along with code from [https://github.com/ricaun/esp32-ttnmapper-gps](https://github.com/ricaun/esp32-ttnmapper-gps).
