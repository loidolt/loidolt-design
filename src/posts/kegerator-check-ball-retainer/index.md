# Summary

This part replaces the small plastic retainer that stops the check valve ball from traveling up the beer outlet tube on a kegerator beer coupler.

Evidently, these parts are way over the top expensive ($8 for a dime size part...) so after losing mine I modeled this replacement.

This part has been printed and tested, it works great!
