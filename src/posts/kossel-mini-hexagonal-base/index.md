In my struggle to contain the wire and visual mess of my Kossel Mini printers, I designed this base.

Designed to fit almost any Kossel Mini style printer up to 220 mm build platform diameter, smaller sizes will work just fine as well. The use of brackets to attach the printer to the base allows very flexible sizes and configurations.

The model shows a Smoothieboard, though there is plenty of room for a RAMPS 1.4 or most other printer control boards in that space instead.

You will need a saw, drill and some patience or a CNC/ laser cutter for the top and bottom sheets that complete the base as well as the bed support and insulation circle. 1:1 scale SVG files are included for all of those pieces. You can either print them out and cut around them or load up your CAM software of choice.

Thanks!
