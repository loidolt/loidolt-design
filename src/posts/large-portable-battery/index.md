## Summary

This is a fairly large, briefcase style, portable battery pack that can be used for drone operations, camping, or emergencies. The pack is comprised of 3 cells of 60 18650 LiIon batteries, for a total of 180 batteries and about 1.6kw of power. 

I spot welded the pack myself using a spot welder I built from [Malectrics Arduino Spot Welder Kit](https://malectrics.eu/product/diy-arduino-battery-spot-welder-prebuilt-kit-v3/). 

The self-contained battery unit has a BMS capable of 100A output, many USB ports, 12v out, a 1000w inverter, and an automotive fuse board.
