## Summary

This isn't really a project on its own but I thought it might be interesting enough to share. This was an attempt to make some sort of branding coin for my longbows. I started off trying to make them by casting resin coins and eventually just carved one out of a piece of antler. In the future, I'd like to figure out a way to do brass ones or possibly a more organic split leaf shape inlay.
