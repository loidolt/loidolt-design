## Summary

We made this thickness sander or limb grinder for making fiberglass laminated bows. The somewhat tricky thing with fiberglass bows is, you cannot adjust the belly thickness due to it being covered in all important fiberglass. So with that in mind, the thickness of the limb pieces to be laminated is critical, as well as consistency between each piece and each limb. That’s where this sander comes into play. I’m not going to explain how to make one because we built ours using the design idea and techniques on this fine gentleman’s [website](https://www.buildyourownbow.com/how-to-make-a-simple-thickness-sander-for-bow-laminations/). Everything you need to know can be found there.
