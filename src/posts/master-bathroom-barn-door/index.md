## Summary

This is a relatively simple build for an interior barn door. The frame is simply stacked 1" thick lumber from home depot and the filler panels are unfinished pine flooring. Special walnut stain was used to provide some "luxury" to the pine and then 3 coats of polyurethane sealed the deal.

I did model and machine a small black HDPE bumper for the bottom roller we used, model provided just in case it comes in handy for someone else.
