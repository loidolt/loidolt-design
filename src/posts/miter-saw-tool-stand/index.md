## Summary

Tool stand for my DeWalt DWS779 Sliding Compound Miter Saw. This stand uses the same simple 2x4 construction as my laser cutter and CNC router tool stands but also features two slide-out work support blocks.

The work support blocks ride on two 36 inch pieces of 3/4 inch square tubing. The rails for the right-hand block slide to the inside of the rails for the left-hand block to allow maximum reach in a small form factor.
