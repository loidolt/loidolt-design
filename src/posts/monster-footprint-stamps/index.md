## Summary

La Plata reached out asking for a monster footprint stamp for a park called "Wild Rumpus Park" in one of their communities. The park is themed loosely around the children's book "Where the Wild Things Are" so they wanted to give the impression that a monster had walked through the park and left footprints.

The footprints were first digitally sculpted in ZBrush before being moved into Fusion 360 for CAM processing. The claws were printed using PLA plastic and bonded to the feet with silicone adhesive and support dowels.

A negative mold was milled out of machinist wax and then a silicone positive was poured with wood blocks for handles. The two handles were intentionally left disconnected to allow some flex and creativity during the stamping process.
