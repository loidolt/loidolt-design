## Summary

During the Giant Egg project, we needed a space to spray paint that was also strong enough to withstand a decent amount of ventilation. To solve that problem, we built this roll-up paint booth in the 3rd car garage bay.

It uses relatively cheap heavy plastic sheeting from Home Depot and 3/4 inch conduit. The conduit is passed through some large bearing blocks and has a custom-designed ratchet on the end to prevent it from un-rolling.

All of the separate plastic panels are combined using filler pieces of plastic and velcro dots to hold them in place.
