# Summary

I made two of these panel meter weather stations, one for my Father and one for my soon to be Father-In-Law for Father's Day 2017. Each weather station uses a Particle Photon to aggregate weather information from an online weather API service called Dark Sky.

This design was based heavily on the great work done by Grady Hillhouse from the [Practical Engineering Blog](https://grady-hillhouse.squarespace.com/). A link to the specific article referenced to create these weather station displays can be found in by clicking the button below.

I'm not going to go into too much detail on how I constructed these since the video and article provided by Grady is already fantastic. Below are links to the svgÂ panel meter faceplates I designed as well as a Fusion 360 file for the wood housing.
