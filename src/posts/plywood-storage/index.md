## Summary

This is my solution to the ever-present issue of plywood storage. This entire project can be cut on a large format CNC, or can easily be made with more traditional tools (and some extra patience for all the wheels.)

Due to the layout of my shop, it is most convenient to load the sheet goods in on edge, sliding them along the wall under my lumber racks. To accommodate this, I build a rack with a series of rollers that give the plywood a bearing surface for easy sliding. Importantly, all the wheels are seperate to allow a single sheet to be removed without rolling everything else out with it. This method is working very well so far.

In front of the plywood storage section, I built a series of bins to store usable scrap stock of varying lengths.
