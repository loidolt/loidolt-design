## Summary

I upgraded my Shapeoko 3 build area using the XL upgrade kit from Carbide 3D. Additionally, I swapped out the Z-axis to the more rigid and higher precision Z-axis from cnc4newbie, link below:

With the upgrade came some enhancements to the machine bench that holds the CNC. First, and obviously, it needed to be enlarged to hold the larger tool. Second, I included a better control panel on the front left with an easy-to-access emergency stop. Finally, all the electronics were relocated to a new box in the back of the tool stand with extra room for future spindle upgrades.
