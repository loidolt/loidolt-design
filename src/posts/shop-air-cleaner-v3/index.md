# Summary

Shop air cleaner built using an extraÂ inline blower fan I had left over from my server cooling system. This version uses two intake filters and one exhaust filter. The inline blower fan is lower CFM than the blower I used in my previous air cleaner, but has a much higher static pressure. This higher static pressure allows the use of more filter material without overloading the fan.

Additionally, this air cleaner uses an ESP8266 based relay board I built to be able to control the cleaner using web-connected services like Google Home or SmartThings.
