## Summary

We built this large barn door to separate the new shop from the rest of the garage. Simple construction using 1/2 inch plywood and 1 inch dimensional lumber. It slides on pretty heavy-duty barn door rollers and tucks into a pocket wall behind the lumber racks.

This door allows us to separate the shop for dust management and noise reasons, but perhaps more importantly to give the heater a break from heating the entire space during the coldest months.
