# Summary

We built this skimboard for my sister Kimmyâ€™s birthday present. Fairly simple construction consisting of 2 sheets of 1/4 inch plywood glued with an induced bend to hold a curved shape and covered in a layer of fiberglass.

Julia made the graphics using Inkscape and then painting templates were cut out on our vinyl cutter. A simple white edge band was painted on to hide the plywood edge and provide a visual interest to the top side of the board.
