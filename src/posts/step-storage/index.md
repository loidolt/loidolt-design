## Summary

Working towards my constant goal of making the shop a joy to use rather than a pain, I've designed this storage shelf with built-in steps to reach the upper shelves. These steps also allow easier access to the upper levels of the lumber rack.

Each step drawer has two heavy-duty ball-bearing drawer slides. It's important to pocket the drawer slides into the shelf sides so they are supported along the entire length.
