## Summary

Laser engraved and cut airplane tail number keychains made on our 80-watt laser cutter. This was our first try using two-tone engraving plastic and the results are pretty great.

We found cutting two faster engraving passes resulted in less contamination of the base plastic than a single higher power operation. Some minor cleanup with sandpaper was needed on the outside edges to brighten up the color transition.
