## Summary

A simple set of tap handles made for my friend's Dad. They were both made "free-form" on the lathe and attach to the tap with a 1/4-20 threaded insert.

The handle on the left of the image with both handles is made from padauk. The handle on the right is maple with a wenge strip down the center.
