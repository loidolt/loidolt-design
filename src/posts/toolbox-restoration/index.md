# Summary

My Dad gave me this old truck bed toolbox that he no longer needed. I cleaned it up with some industrial degreaser, removed the old weatherstripping, and painted it with Rust-OleumÂ spray truck bed liner. I replaced the locks (missing keys) and recreated the latch using the old one as a guide.

On a side note, I cannot stress enough that you should never use Rust-Oleum's spray truck bed liner for anything. It's a really poorly designed product that clogs the spray nozzle every single time.
