# About

I have three rackmount servers, a router, compute server, and storage server. Rackmount servers, while powerful and cheap (cost to performance wise) when bought second hand, are loud and awkwardÂ in the home environment.

This vertical rackmount server cabinet is my attempt to contain the mess and noise of these machines while providing them excellent and clean airflow.
