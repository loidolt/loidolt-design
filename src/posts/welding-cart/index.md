## Summary

I needed a place to safely store all my welding equipment, especially the tanks. I built this cart to hold everything I had at the time with some room for future expansion, including an argon and CO2 tank. The drawers section is from Harbor Freight, buying theirs and integrating it made more sense than trying to make my own.
