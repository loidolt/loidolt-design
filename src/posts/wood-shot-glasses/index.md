## Summary

I finally got a lathe, after roughly six years of wishing I had one. I decided to make some shot glasses to run it through its paces. What better way to break in a lathe than to make shot glasses to drink to its honor right? These were much less thought out than most of my projects. More of a go-with-the-flow and figure-things-out-as-I-work type thing.

There are several shot glasses pictured in the gallery below. They are in order of when they were made. As I got more comfortable, I began to experiment with different glue-ups and finishes. I found CA glue to be the most practical finish as it completely seals the wood in what is essentially a layer of plastic.

They all hold water well. The padauk is better at not being affected by moisture, even without an oil finish. Itâ€™s also the lightest and easiest to work with by a lot.
