# About

These spatulas were made as a Christmas present for my Mother, Kathy Loidolt. The thin wood for the spatula itself is some cherry I had left over from another project, and the handle "scales" are purpleheart.

Not a lot to say about the construction of these.  I simply traced a couple existing kitchen utensils that I liked the shape of, glued on some purpleheart for the handles, and shaped it all using various sanders and files.

Both spatulas were finished with a mineral oil/ beeswax mix for a water-resistant, food safe finish.

I attempted to bring back some of the purpleheart color more quickly by baking the spatulas in the oven at 250 degrees F for about 20 minutes. I believe it worked to some degree but was not as impressive as I hoped. The bright purple color will come back on its own in just a few weeks.
