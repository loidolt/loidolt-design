## Summary

Quick fix for a wooden spoon that was ruined after being run through the dishwasher.

Due to the oily nature of wooden kitchen utensils, I had to reinforce the glue joint between the original spoon wood and the new maple block with a couple of metal pins. After adding the pins I was able to shape and repair the spoon without the maple block breaking off.

Refinished with a mineral oil/ beeswax mix.
