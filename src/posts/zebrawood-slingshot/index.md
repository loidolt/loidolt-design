# Summary

It had been a very long time since I last made a slingshot - at least a decade. I thought it would be fun to give it a try again. Zebra wood is a little silly for a project like this but I had a scrap piece laying around that was the right size.

I prefer “over the top” style shooters instead of “through the fork.” The frame is designed to be used with three point grip or a normal ham fist grip. I prefer the three point style where my palm, index finger, and thumb work together to support the load. I hand-shaped the frame using a hand saw and a lot of rasping and filing.

The bands are made of Theraband Gold - two strips on each side. Each strip is 3 cm on the frame side and 2 cm at the pouch, with an overall length of 20 cm. There are a lot of tutorials online for attaching bands to pouches and frames, but basically, it’s just wrapping a thin strip a bunch of times and then under itself once. Pouch is about 6 cm long and 2 cm tall. Not totally sure because I just eyeballed it.

Slingshot works great and is an absolute joy to shoot. And isn’t that all anyone ever wants out of a slingshot anyway? Might add a third band to each side sometime in the future to give it a little more power.
